Tyrannis Update: Anthony Jackson produced a new Tyrannis-compatible release with a number of other cool improvements! You can get it here: [NavBot rev L](http://navbot.googlecode.com/files/NavBot-L.exe) - nice work, Tony!

EVE Online is a space-based MMORPG. One aspect of EVE is trading - in particular, I'm talking about ferrying items from one station to another for profit (rather than market speculation).

NavBot is a beautifully-simple piece of code that sits in your taskbar and provides an interface through the in-game browser (IGB) that mimics conversations with in-game agents. It automatically searches for the most profitable routes, using your exported market data.

In the last few months NavBot has had a real overhaul from Michael Mitchell, who's added a lot of the features everyone's been asking for - allowing for tax in profit calculations, proper security route handling, minimum quantity awareness - and also a few cool new tricks such as filling the hold with multiple types of items to really maximize your profit! Check out the RecentChanges page for more info, and be sure to let Michael know if you enjoy the new version!
