# Working on NavBot #

The more, the merrier! Post a bit about yourself and your programming background [here](http://beautifullycraftedsoftware.blogspot.com/2007/10/navbot-goes-open-source.html) to get added to the project.

There is a discussion group [here](http://groups.google.com/group/navbot?hl=en).

NavBot is written in C# using Visual Studio Express 2008 - freely available from Microsoft.

NavBot is also fully unit-tested, and is intended to stay that way! You need NUnit to run the tests - available [here](http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download).

[Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads) is recommended for working with the repository.
